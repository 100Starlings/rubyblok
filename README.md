# Rubyblok
## Introduction
Rubyblok is a versatile Ruby gem designed for a Content Management System (CMS) integration.
This gem offers an easy way to integrate a visual CMS - Storyblok - into your Rails app, providing you with quality-of-life features.

This integration allows you to edit your content online, preview it in real-time, and publish with just the click of a button.

In addition, Rubyblok provides an abstraction layer and stores all your content locally, reducing data usage and enhancing performance. This enables new functionalities that leverage the local data, such as global content search, sitemaps, and listings. Ultimately, this setup increases resilience by eliminating dependency on external data sources.

## Installation
Rubyblok 1.0 works with Rails 6.0 onwards. Run:
```bash
bundle add rubyblok
```

### Storyblok account and new space
[Click here](https://app.storyblok.com/#/signup) to create a free acount at Storyblok, the CMS platform where you will have access to the visual and real-time content editing.

Create a new Space, in _My Spaces > Add Space_. Select the free Community plan by clicking its "Continue" button and give your space a name.

Get your Storyblok API token in your account, at _Storyblok Space > Settings > Access tokens_ page. Copy the "Preview" access level key.

Add the API token to your `config/initializers/rubyblok.rb` file:

```
config.api_token = <your API token>
```

## Getting Started

### Hello world - Your first Rubyblok page
Let's get started with Rubyblok by creating your first page in three steps.
Note that it is important that you have your Storyblok space set up as described above, in the `Storyblok account and new space` section.

1. First, you need to run the install generator, which will create the initializer for you:
```bash
rails g rubyblok:install
```

2. Now let's generate and run a migration to create the `pages` table and the `Page` model:
```bash
rails g rubyblok:migration PAGE

rails db:migrate
```

3. Finally, let's generate your first page:
```bash
rails g rubyblok:hello_world PAGE
```
This will automatically create a new `/pages` route, a `PagesController`, views and styling for your hello world page.

For this example, go to the `config/initializers/rubyblok.rb` file and turn the caching option off:
```
config.cached = false
```

Now you have created your first Hello World page! Start your Rails server, access the `/pages` route and you will be able to see the page.

### Activate the visual editor 
Here are the steps to configure the visual editor at Storyblok. This allows you to see a preview of your changes in the Storyblok interface as you edit and save.

At Storyblok, select your Space and go to _Settings > Visual Editor_. 

In the "Location (default environment)" input, add your localhost address:
```
https://localhost:3333
```

Then we have to create a local proxy. For that, first create a PEM certificate for your `localhost`:

```bash
brew install mkcert
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost
```

This will create the `localhost-key.pem` and `localhost.pem` files.

To run the proxy, use the `local-ssl-proxy` tool:

```bash
npm install local-ssl-proxy -g
local-ssl-proxy --source 3333 --target 3000 --cert localhost.pem --key localhost-key.pem
```

This will start a proxy server.

By doing this initial setup, you are able to see your first Storyblok page inside your app and edit its content in the Storyblok admin interface ðŸŽ‰

## Rubyblok tags

### rubyblok_story_tag
Use this tag to render stories:
```
# Slug: full_slug of the storyblok story
<%= rubyblok_story_tag(slug) %>
```
The name of the storyblok block should match the rails partial, ie if the block is named `header`, it should have a corresponding `_header.html.erb` partial in the directory defined in `config.component_path`. The partial is called with a `blok` local variable which contains the storyblok block properties.

### rubyblok_content_tag
It renders content of Text, TextArea, Markdown or Richtext storyblok fields.
```
<%= rubyblok_content_tag(content) %>
```

Optionally, you can use the `rubyblok_markdown_tag` or `rubyblok_richtext_tag` tags for rendering specific content.
```
# Markdown text
<%= rubyblok_markdown_tag("this is a **mark** down") %>
# Output: "<p>this is a <strong>mark</strong> down</p>"

# Richtext
text = { 
         "type" => "doc",
         "content" => [
           { "type" => "paragraph",
             "content" => [{ "text" => "this is a richtext", "type" => "text" }]
            }
         ]
       }

<%= rubyblok_richtext_tag text > %> 
# Output: "<p>this is a richtext</p>"
```

### rubyblok_blocks_tag
Use this tag to render more than one component:
```
<%= rubyblok_blocks_tag(blok.bloks) %>
```

### Updating content manually at the caching layer
In case you need to update the caching layer with new content added to Storyblok, run the following command:
```
# Slug: full_slug of the storyblok story
storyblok_story = Rubyblok::Services::GetStoryblokStory.call(slug: slug)
<MODEL_NAME>.find_or_create(storyblok_story)
```

## Rubyblok workflows

### Non-cached mode (default)
Rubyblok fetches the content via the Storyblok API and the content is not cached locally.

### Cached mode
Rubyblok fetches the content from the local database. This mode is useful ie. if you don't want to call the API on every page request or you want to index the content locally. To enable this mode you need to set the cached feature on in the `config/initializers/rubyblok.rb` file:
```
config.cached = true
```

If you want to update the local cache on every page request (ie. the content is not updated via the webhook), you need to set the auto_update feature on in the `config/initializers/rubyblok.rb` file:
```
config.auto_update = true
```

## Storyblok webhook
The Storyblok webhook will be responsible for updating and deleting content in the local database in case of changes. [Learn more here.](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/guide/in-depth/webhooks)

Generate the webhook controller:
```bash
rails g rubyblok:webhook_controller STORYBLOK_WEBHOOK
```

## Caching storyblok images
You can store your storyblok images and videos on your own S3 storage by enabling this rubyblok feature.

1. First, you need to run the image cache generator, which will create the model file, the uploader file and the carrierwave config file for you:
```bash
rails g rubyblok:image_cache STORYBLOK_IMAGE
```

2. Add the following gems to your Gemfile:
```
bundle add 'carrierwave'
bundle add 'fog-aws'

```

3. Now let's run a migration to create the `storyblok_images` table:
```bash
rails db:migrate
```

4. Finally, enable the image cache feature in the `config/initializers/rubyblok.rb` file:
```
config.use_cdn_images = true
```

Please note that it caches only images added as an `Asset` field type in Storyblok.

## Caching views

You can enable fragment caching on rubyblok components by setting the cache_views feature on in the `config/initializers/rubyblok.rb` file:
```
config.cache_views = true
```
Please note that if any of the component partials changes you need to clear the cache.

## Sitemap configuration
You can generate a sitemap configuration for your website with the following command:
```
rails g rubyblok:sitemap_config
```
This generator will create a sitemap configuration for the `sitemap_generator` gem and add the gem to your Gemfile in case it's not already there.
The sitemap is generated only for cached content. Please make sure that the `cached` configuration value is `true` on `config/initializers/rubyblok.rb`.
Open `config/sitemap.rb` and add your hostname:
```
# ...

# TODO: Configure your hostname here
SitemapGenerator::Sitemap.default_host = ''

# ...
```
For example:
```
# ...

# TODO: Configure your hostname here
SitemapGenerator::Sitemap.default_host = 'https://myhost.com'

# ...
```
In order to generate your sitemap or customize this configuration, please read [the sitemap_generator gem documentation](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator).
